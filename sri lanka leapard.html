            </div>
            <section class="udawalawe">
                <h3>Udawalawe National Park</h3>
                <p>Udawalawe is the place to go for elephants. While you’ll see them in most parks, Udawalawe has a population of around 500. It’s located about four hours away from Colombo by car, and at 300 square kilometres in size, it’s much smaller than Yala. There’s very little forest cover to obscure the view, as many of the trees in the centre of the park died after a season of severe monsoon flooding.

                    Along with elephants, you’ll see monkeys, deer, crocodiles, flying squirrels, buffalo, and – for those with particularly good eye-sight – chameleons (our eagle-eyed driver somehow managed to spot a medium-sized one on a branch from about 25 feet away. It blew my mind as I struggled to see it from about five feet away). Sloth bear and leopard sightings aren’t unheard of, but are pretty rare here. The park also contains around 180 different types of birds and if you’re a keen bird-watcher, November and December are the best months to visit.
                    
                    Also worth a mention for lovers of these (generally) gentle giants are Minneriya and Kandulla national parks, which are famous for the ‘Gathering’ – the seasonal congregation of elephants in September and October. Up to 300 elephants will meet by Minneriya Lake on the lush grassland that forms as the lake dries out. There isn’t a sight like it in the world.
                    
                    If you go to Sri Lanka expecting to see a leopard, you’ll most likely come away disappointed. But never fear, you’ll be more than satisfied for wildlife.</p>

                <h3>Horton National Park</h3>
                <p>The misty highlands of Sri Lanka is hardly a place one would imagine encountering a leopard. But despite this, historically, the highlands are where most of the island forests are covered, it was and where most of the wildlife animals roamed. With the onset of the British taking over the country, they cleared these vast forests to grow Coffee and subsequently Tea.

                    One of the last remaining highland wilderness refuges is Horton Plains, National Park. Located over 2500 meters above sea level, this montane wilderness is set atop a high plateau and is one of Mother Nature’s most spectacular wonders.
                    
                    Once even used by the government at the time to grow potatoes it was later declared a National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                    
                    This land is one of the most sensitive and ecologically significant locations in the country – with a vast number of plants and animal life being endemic and found nowhere else in the world.
                    
                    The park was very popular for its scenic landscapes and walking trails. Subsequently was highly valued as a top birding destination to see some of the rare highland endemic species.
                    
                    In the last few years, through countless visits and patience, this too has produced some unforgettable leopard encounters.
                    
                    The kings of this domain, these predators are found in the deep dense cloud forests and on the fringes of the open plains which are the main landscapes of this habitat.
                    
                    Feeding primarily on Sambhur the largest species of deer in Sri Lanka these cats seem to have a few physiological differences from their lowland cousins. The Horton Plains Leopards seem to be much larger in physical size and their faces wider with shorter muzzle areas giving them a stouter and wider look.
                    
                    A study carried out by a scientific team consisting of Dr Enoka Kudavidanage in 2020 has identified 23 adult leopards found in the park.
                    
                    Seeing these majestic predators is much harder than in the lowlands, but with a trained eye and patience, you might have a chance in getting a glimpse of these highland beauties. </p>

                <h3>Wilpaththu National Park</h3>
                <p>The land of lakes, Wilpattu is located on the North-Western end of the island. This is Sri Lanka’s largest national park and is quite a contrast to the landscape of Yala. Where Yala is mostly dry scrub forest, open lagoons and plains, as well as many rocky outcrops, Wilpattu is denser with dark forests being the dominant landscape, along with few open spaces which are usually consisting of natural lakes known as Villus. The dense dark forests make it quite difficult to see these predators, but when they do come onto the roads it is a sight to behold. The open sand brimmed lakes are some of the most beautiful settings to view these magnificent predators. The park was closed for many years during the time of the civil war and was finally opened to the public in 2010. During this time, the leopards were very shy and sightings were almost nonexistent. But over time, after a few years of continuous visitation, the leopards gradually became habituated enough to give some great sightings. Through the years, Wilpattu has become increasingly popular, especially with wildlife purist who seek more private and quieter moments compared to Yala which can tend to be congested and crowded. The chances of seeking leopards in Wilpattu is somewhat harder than Yala, but usually, the reward of the sighting is far greater most of the time due to the lower numbers in the park and the ability to spread out across the landscape given the size of the park. One of the most photographed leopards from back in the day was the infamous “Prince” a.k.a “Natta” who was a young male leopard who was born in the Kompanchi Sampuwal/Pomparippu area and later moved around to many parts of the park.

                    He was at one time the most photographed leopard in Sri Lanka, giving shows like no other, often sleeping in the middle of the road paying no need to the onlooking people and vehicles. He was named Natta because the end of his tail fell off due to an injury probably with a wild boar or another leopard. He is still alive but has been driven out to the fringes of the park by larger and more dominant males. One of the most famous and well-loved males of the park is the Nelum Wila Male, a massive individual who has a large home range and is seen quite often walking without fear of people. He is the current star of the park and one who poses for the photographs. When it comes to the female’s one of the most beloved leopards has to be “Cleopatra” the beautiful female who was known as a playful cub from Borupanwila. Now a successful mother with her brood of cubs is seen by lucky visitors mostly in the Mahapatessa area with her cubs.</p>

           <h3>Threaths faced by the Sri Lankan Leapard</h3>
           <!--add more images -->

            <p>
                The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) faces a complex array of threats jeopardizing its survival. One major challenge is habitat loss, driven by human activities like agriculture and urbanization. As natural landscapes shrink, the leopards' territories dwindle, putting their survival at risk.
                
                In the intricate dance between humans and wildlife, human-wildlife conflict adds a sinister note. Encroachment into leopard habitats leads to clashes, especially with farmers, as leopards occasionally prey on livestock. This conflict often triggers retaliatory measures, endangering the leopards and creating a negative perception of them.
                
                Despite legal protections, poaching looms as a dark shadow over the Sri Lankan leopard. The illegal wildlife trade, fueled by demand for leopard skins and body parts, poses a persistent threat. This not only reduces their population but also fuels a dangerous trade network.
                
                Compounding the challenge is the depletion of prey species essential for the leopard's sustenance. Changes in land use, hunting practices, and competition with other predators collectively contribute to a diminishing prey availability, forcing leopards to adapt to new, less hospitable environments.
                
                The fragmentation of leopard populations worsens the situation. Human-induced alterations create isolated leopard communities, reducing genetic diversity and making them more susceptible to diseases. This undermines the species' resilience and adaptability.
                
                Climate change adds another layer of complexity. Shifting temperature and precipitation patterns affect prey distribution, disrupting the balance sustaining leopard populations.
                
                Addressing these challenges requires concerted efforts. Conservation initiatives in Sri Lanka focus on habitat protection, community-based programs, anti-poaching measures, and education. Collaboration between government bodies, NGOs, and local communities is crucial in forming a united front against the threats faced by the Sri Lankan leopard. Through these initiatives, there is hope for the coexistence and preservation of this iconic species in Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity.</p>
