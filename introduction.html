                <p>Horton Plains National Park is one of the smallest national parks in Sri Lanka. 
                    But, despite the size, it is one of the most amazing parks in Sri Lanka. 
                    It is also one of the very few national parks in Sri Lanka where visitors are allowed to walk.
                    
                    Situated in the central highlands, Horton Plains National Park has the highest altitude among all the national parks in Sri Lanka. It is 2,100–2,300 metres (6,900–7,500 ft). It belongs to Nuwara Eliya District, Central Province. And it is bordered by Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces. Horton Plains is the headwaters of three of four major rivers in Sri Lanka, namely, Mahaweli, Kelani, Walawe.
                    
                    This place is very rich in bio-diversity. Numerous varieties of species can be found there and many of them are endemic not only to Sri Lanka but also to this particular Park. Other than the breathtaking beauty, it is another main reason why this park is a major tourist attraction. The Park is also called ‘Maha Eliya Plains’ (මහ එලිය තැන්න).

                    <p>Spanning a landmass of 8,000 hectares, and a major contributor to the area’s biodiversity due to the presence of the Minneriya Tank, the Minneriya National Park is a treasure trove of endemic flora and fauna. Although known to be a wildlife reserve, the park has quite a rich history that goes back to the 3rd century, during the reign of King Mahasen. This is because of the Minneriya Tank, as it was originally built to irrigate the lands to cultivate paddy, however, it now serves as a major source for the wildlife that dwells in the area. According to the Wildlife Conservation Department, there are 24 species of mammals, 160 species of birds, 9 species of amphibians, 25 species of reptiles, 26 species of fish, and 75 species of butterflies that take refuge in the greenery of the reserve.</p>
